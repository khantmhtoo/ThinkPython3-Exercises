1. The volume of a sphere with radius r is (4/3)πr^3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?
2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs
$3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for
60 copies?
3. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at
tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?
